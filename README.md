# LED-Pomodoro-Timer
Raspberry Pi Pico LED Pomodoro Timer using a Pico Unicorn Pack

The Pico Unicorn pack was a good opportunity to create a pomodoro timer which was not software based. I have one to remind me to take breaks when working while also making a handy indicator to others when I'm in a meeting or gone to lunch.

Buttons: 
A - Randomised LEDs set to a speed that I found gave a nice visual effect. 
B - Generates a rainbow pattern then resets in a loop once all across. 
X - Pomodoro Timer (25 minutes red countdown then switches to a 5 minute green count down)
Y - Clears the screen.
